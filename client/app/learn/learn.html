People around the world rely on OpenStreetMap data contributed by millions of people over the past 10 years. While it is easy to get started, it does take some effort and practice to do well. If this is your first time mapping, please take about 30 mins to watch the video (in English with multi-language subtitles) to learn the basics of how to map using the OSM web browser based editor called iD. Please, now and in the future, always focus on quality, not quantity of mapping you do.' | translate }}</p>
