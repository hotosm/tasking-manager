                        OSM Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team
                        collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks
                        that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the
                        mapping validated
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach facilitates the distribution of tasks to the various mappers in a context of
                        emergency. It also permits control of the progress and the homogeneity of the work done (e.g.
                        elements to cover, specific tags to use, etc.).
