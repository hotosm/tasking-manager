# Mapbox access key to display the maps (optional)
#
# In order to use the default basemap, you’ll need to set a
# Mapbox token (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token) from your Mapbox account.
# Costs apply to usage of Mapbox maps above 50,000 map loads per month; if you’d like to ask for
# account support to cover those costs, contact Mapbox Community https://mapbox.com/community.
#
# If you do not set a token, then maps will fallback to using the raster tile based
# Humanitarian Layer.
