The most popular tool for teams to coordinate mapping on
OpenStreetMap. With this web application, an area of interest can be
defined and divided up into smaller tasks that can be completed
rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need a
review for quality assurance. You can see the tool in action: log into
the widely used [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) and
start mapping.

This is Free and Open Source Software. You are welcome to use the code
and set up your own instance. The Tasking Manager has been initially
designed and built by and for the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap
Team](https://www.hotosm.org/), and is nowadays used by many
communities and organizations.
