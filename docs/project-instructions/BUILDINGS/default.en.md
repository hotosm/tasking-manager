## Buildings

* Two-minute Tutorial: Buildings - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1YJV6I_rhY
* Please accurately outline all the buildings you can find. The outline should be for the full size of the building even if it is partly covered by trees in the imagery.
* Take care to not include the building shadow in the building outline.
* After drawing the outline and tagging as a building, **use the 'Q' key in the iD & JOSM editors to "square" the corners**. We suggest using the Buildings plug-in in JOSM to make building tracing more efficient.
* Buildings may be very close, but do not actually touch each other, try to map them close to each other without letting them connect or share nodes with each other, roads or residential area outlines. In the iD web editor, holding down the "alt" key will keep nodes from "snapping" to each other and accidentally connecting.
* In the iD web editor, you will only have the option to tag new features as buildings, see below for editing or adding other features.

**Only if you have personal knowledge of a building**, please add that information to the building, like the name or type of building (hospital, school, gas station, etc)
