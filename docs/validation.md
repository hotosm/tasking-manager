# Validation

Validation is the final step of the mapping process. It is necessary
to ensure good quality data. Validation requires a slightly different
skill set than just being a good mapper. Being an experienced mapper is
a good start of course.

For Tasking Manager, validators review the work of the remote
mappers. It is not unusual that features get misidentified by the
mappers due to poor imagery. Validators have much experience with
identifying obscure buildings types in different countries.

Being a validator is more than being a mapper. As a person dealing
with quality issues, a validator is also a mentor to other mappers,
improving their skills as well. Mentoring of course requires an
ability to communicate mistakes with empathy and understanding, as we
all make mistakes...
