# Contributing to the Tasking Manager

## Welcome

First off, I'm really glad you're reading this, because we
need volunteer developers to help improve the Tasking Manager.!

We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels and we are
committed to making sure your participation in our tech collective is
inclusive, enjoyable and rewarding. If you have never contributed to
an open-source project before, we are a good place to start and will
make sure you are supported every step of the way. If you have **any**
questions, please ask!

We are collaborating with [Naxa](https://www.naxa.com.np/) on the
maintenance of the Tasking Manager - expect to hear a lot from all of
us on Github :-)

There are many ways to contribute to the Tasking Manager Project:

## Report bugs and suggest improvements:

The [issue queue](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/issues) is
the best way to get started. There are issue templates for BUGs and
FEATURES that you can use, or you can create your own. Once you have
submitted an issue, it will be assigned one label out of the following
[label categories](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/labels):

- **Backlog**:  Backlog=triage will first be assigned to any new issues
- **Component**

On a monthly basis, we will collaboratively triage issues from the
*backlog=triage* and assign one of the below labels:

- **Assigned**: once reviewed the issue will be assigned either to
  hot_tech OR tm_collective. Issues assigned to tm_collective are
  where we really need your help!
- **Type**: specifying whether the issue is a bug or feature/enhancement
- **Priority**: specifying the priority level for each issue. We want
  to collaboratively agree on the criteria for prioritisation.
- **Status**: specifying whether the issue is in progress or done.
- **Experience**: we have added a beginner label for good first
  issues. We will work with the community to update the labels in this
  category and make them suitable.

Note: Issues older than 6 months from the point of raising the issue
with no engagement will be labelled as *archived*.

## Testing

Test a bug fix or new feature. Once an issue has been addressed and
Pull Request (PR) change deployed to the [Tasking Manager Staging
site](https://tasks-stage.hotosm.org/), you will be able to view and
test the change on the staging site. If you notice any issues while
testing, please comment on the PR directly.

## Code contributions

Create pull requests (PRs) for changes that you think are needed. We
would really appreciate your help! We ask that you follow our [coding
contribution guidelines](contributing-guidelines.md)

as it makes Tasking Manager more efficient when it supports local
languages.
